### About This Project
This application predicts the toxicity, solubility, and intoxicant potential of chemical compounds using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model. It also provides detailed chemical information and 2D/3D visualization for any molecule you enter.

#### What is a SMILES string?
- **SMILES** (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a compact, human-readable way to represent a molecule's structure as a line of text using short ASCII strings.
- Each atom is represented by its atomic symbol (e.g., C for carbon, O for oxygen), and bonds are implied by the order or explicitly denoted with symbols (e.g., = for double bond, # for triple bond).
- **Rings** are represented by numbers (e.g., benzene is `c1ccccc1`), and **branches** by parentheses (e.g., isopropanol is `CC(C)O`).
- SMILES can encode complex molecules, including stereochemistry (e.g., `F[C@H](Cl)Br` for a chiral center).
- **Why is SMILES important?**
    - It allows computers to store, search, and analyze chemical structures efficiently.
    - It is the standard input for cheminformatics tools, machine learning models, and chemical databases.
    - SMILES is used for virtual screening, property prediction, and molecular design in drug discovery and materials science.
- **Examples:**
    - Ethanol: `CCO`
    - Benzene: `c1ccccc1`
    - Aspirin: `CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O`
    - Glucose: `C(C1C(C(C(C(O1)O)O)O)O)O`
- You can enter either a SMILES string or a common compound name (like "aspirin") in this app. The app will resolve names to SMILES automatically using PubChem.
- **Note:** Not all names can be resolved, and invalid SMILES will be flagged by the app.

#### What is a Graph Neural Network (GNN)?
- A **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** is a type of deep learning model specifically designed to operate on data structured as graphs, rather than regular grids (like images) or sequences (like text).
- **Why graphs?** Many real-world systems are naturally graphs: molecules (atoms as nodes, bonds as edges), social networks, protein interactions, etc.
- **How does a GNN work?**
    - Each node (atom) starts with a feature vector (e.g., atomic number, hybridization, charge).
    - The GNN iteratively updates each node's features by aggregating information from its neighbors (other atoms it's bonded to) using a process called "message passing."
    - After several rounds, the network learns a rich, context-aware representation of each atom and the whole molecule.
- **In this app:**
    - The GNN is trained on the Tox21 dataset, which contains thousands of molecules labeled for toxicity.
    - The model learns to predict toxicity, solubility, and intoxicant potential by analyzing the molecular graph structure.
    - The GNN can generalize to new molecules by recognizing patterns in how atoms are connected and what features they have.
- **Advantages of GNNs in chemistry:**
    - Naturally handle variable-sized, complex molecular structures.
    - Capture both local (atom-level) and global (molecule-level) chemical information.
    - Outperform traditional machine learning on many molecular property prediction tasks.
- **Types of GNN layers:**
    - Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
    - Graph Attention Networks (GAT)
    - Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN)
- **Limitations:**
    - GNNs require large, high-quality datasets for training.
    - They may not capture all quantum or 3D effects unless explicitly modeled.
    - Interpretability can be challenging, but tools like attention maps and feature importance help.
- **Summary:**
    - GNNs are revolutionizing cheminformatics and drug discovery by enabling accurate, scalable, and flexible molecular property prediction.
